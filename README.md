Hello! I'm @ehuezod. I am a Software Developer specialized in full stack web applications.
I have developed experience in the following technologies:
- Front End (HTML, CSS and JavaScript)
- Backend Development with .Net Framework
- SQL and NoSQL data bases such as MongoDB, MySQL and SQLServer
- React, JQuery and Bootstrap
- Agile methodologies (Scrum)

In this profile you'll find some of my personal projects that show the process that I've had to get to my current level. I can write that effectively solves problems and get involved in any part of the development process, from requirement specification, to planning, execution and maintenance of ongoin projects.

I'm interested in showcasing these skills and help to make other projects successful.
